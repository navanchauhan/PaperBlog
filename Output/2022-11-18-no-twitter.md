# What replaces Twitter?
Was talking to a friend and we could not answer the question what is going to replace Twitter? There exists no platform which you would want to use for broadcasting messages and for instant updates. 

Also, using a fountain pen for such a small notebook sucks 

Anyway, we wouldn't really call TikTok a social media platform. It is more like Vine or You Twe.
